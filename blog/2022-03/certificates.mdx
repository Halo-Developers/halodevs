From my experience, I have found that the best way to get courses is to get them by field experts with certificates, and the most platforms that offer this service for me are:

**COURSERA** and **COGNITIVE CLASSES**

## COURSERA

COURSERA is a free learning site that offers **MOOC**s _(Massive Open Online Courses)_ **courses** from well-known universities. All COURSERA courses contain pre-recorded video lectures that you can watch when it is convenient for you.

:::important
Most COURSERA courses are paid in the first look, but you can ask for financial support to get a free courses with their certificates as much as you want.

Check **How To Get Financial Support** section below.
:::

Coursera has programs together with universities that allow you to get a master degree or specializations. You can explore various college courses without any hassle.

This site is offering free programs from accredited institutions. These free certification courses online available on this platform are designed by a leading university.

### Top Online Courses

- **Computer Science**: Java, C++, Javascript, Blockchain, Linux, Data Science, IOT, etc.
- **Information Technology**: CyberSecurity, AWS, Google Cloud, SAP, and more.
- **Science and Engineering**: Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy, and more.
- **Business**: Leadership and Management, Finance, Marketing, Entrepreneurship, and more.
- **Social Sciences**: Economics, Education, Governance and Society, Law, etc.
- **Language Learning**: Learning English, Chinese, Korean, etc.

### How To Get Financial Support

Let's see a simple example, I want to get a free courses with certificates from **COURSERA** about `Statistics`. I searched for the course and then I found this one by **Stanford University**:

[Introduction to Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/stanford-statistics?)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/158124001-94eb177f-06a5-4c88-83ec-63ded1c751ee.png)

Registration is free, but later you need to pay to keep going with it. Also you can see there is a **Aide financiÃ¨re disponible** button, which you can click to get a financial support.

Let's fill this first form:

![Frame 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/158125540-5fc32a50-954b-4f4d-bec2-ecccf109c511.png)

For the Question **Pourquoi dÃ©posez-vous une demande d'aide financiÃ¨re?**, just copy and past this answer:

` Iâ€™m a student from Morocco and want to learn Data Science. I think it will be beneficial for my work. But Iâ€™ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship, it is very much difficult for me to gather such an amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So Iâ€™m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help me perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments that are peer-reviewed which I believe will be an invaluable learning opportunity.`

Then check the checkbox **J'ai vÃ©rifiÃ© que mes informations sont Ã  jour** and click **Suivant**:

Then for the question : **De quelle faÃ§on ce cours vous aidera-t-il Ã  atteindre vos objectifs?**, just copy and past this answer:

`It is no doubt that Machine Learning opens up lots of opportunities for oneâ€™s career. The field took off in the 2010s and has been growing ever since. ML experts and Data Scientists are some of the most well-paid jobs in the world. I plan to use this course to improve my knowledge about the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Data Science. I plan to eventually specialize in Deep Learning after having learned and practiced the basics well enough. I read that this course also includes several practice assignments and a project, doing which would be immensely beneficial to the improvement of my practical skills in this area. Completing this course would also provide me the confidence to dive deep into data science and take on further challenging assignments. All of this would greatly help me in achieving my career goals in the future and also help me in eventually getting a data science job.`

Then check the checkboxes like below and click **Examiner**:
